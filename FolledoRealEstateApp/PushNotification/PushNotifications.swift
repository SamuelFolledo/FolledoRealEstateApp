Then we need to pass another key "include_player_ids" with a value of userPushIds which will send notifications to all this users in this array of userPushIds, and since our array only contains one Id, it will only send to one user
        ProgressHUD.showSuccess("Notification Sent")

func getUserToPush(userId: String, result: @escaping(_ pushIds: [String]) -> Void) { //RE ep.121 2mins gets the owner of the property that we can send the notification to. This func gets a userId: and a callback that returns an array of pushIds //SUMMARY we are passing our userId, we find this user in firebase, we get the user and convert it to FUser from the dictionary, then we call our callback function which returns an array of pushIds. The reason we are using an array here is because OneSignal, when we send a notification, it doesnt accept a String, but an array of Strings (array of pushIds)
